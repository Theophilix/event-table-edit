# Event Table Edit
Event Table Edit (abbrev. ETE) is a free and open source table plugin for Joomla 2.5, 3.x and above (original author: Manuel Kaspar, continuation: Matthias Gruhn). With the plugin, you can create a responsive, editable table with CSV import and export function and XML export/import for table settings. It also has a full rights management (Joomla ACL). 
You can  transform the table into an appointment booking system with confirmation emails for users and the admin, including iCal-calendar-files for both in the attachment. As it is based on a CSS-template, the layout of the table can be changed easily. The responsive function is based on the "Column Toggle Table with Mini Map" from the tablesaw plugins (https://github.com/filamentgroup/tablesaw).
